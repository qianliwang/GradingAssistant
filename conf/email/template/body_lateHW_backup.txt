Hi,#####:
How are you?
According to our records you did not submit last week's homework assignment on time.  All assignments should be turned in before the deadline. Any assignments turned in after the due date/time will receive 80% of the maximum credits. Late homework is accepted for one week after the due date. Homework turned in more than one week late will receive no credit.
However, late homework is accepted one week after the due date without penalty if you have one of the following reasons:
(a) college sponsored trips
(b) illness with a doctor's note
(c) evidence of a personal emergency.
Please note that you still have a chance to turn in your homework for 80% of credit if you send it within one week after the deadline. I hope you can turn in your future homework assignment on time next week.
I would like to help you to resolve any problems you have. Please let me know when you can meet. Here is my available time slots for meeting this week:
Tuesday 2:00-3:00PM, Wednesday 3:00-4:00PM, Thursday 3:00-4:00PM
Location: B17 Atanasoff Hall.
Please respond to me once you receive this message.
Sincerely
COMS 106X TA
